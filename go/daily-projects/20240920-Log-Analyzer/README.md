### Description: 
A great project that involves both file I/O and buffers in Go is to build a simple log file analyzer. This program will read a log file, count the occurrences of different log levels (e.g., INFO, WARN, ERROR), and then output the counts.

Requirements:

	1.	Read a file using buffered I/O.
	2.	Process each line and identify the log level (INFO, WARN, ERROR).
	3.	Keep track of the occurrences of each log level.
	4.	Print the summary of log levels to the console.

#### Question:
	I am learning Go and trying to build a habit of writing code every day. Could you give me a small project that may take 20-30 min to do in Go today? Also could you make it related to File I/O and buffers since I need to learn more about them?
